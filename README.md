=============================

#Objectives
1. To define the terms of a working and living institution/movement that is not only replicable but built by the industry and for the industry.
2. All of the programs, exercises, objectives, methodologies must be modular, dynamic and updatable, allowing any intervenient, wether a student, a teacher, a mentor or a company, to contribute to it's evolution and adaptation with up-to-date tech requirements and industry needs.
3. A learn-by-doing methodology must be at the core of all. It is imperative that students learn in a collaborative environment and develop hard and soft skills alike.
4. Every designer should know how to code or what good code is like. Every programmer should know how to design or what good design is like.

#Caveats
* Different students will have different life objectives. Expectactions management is crucial for the succcess of the school.
* Different students will also have different skill levels and special needs. It is important to create tools, methodologies and options so that everyone is able to build it's own curriculum with clear targets in sight.
* The industry and technology evolve at a far faster pace than traditional universities. Agility and modularity can help keep the pace so that every exercise, project and topic is kept in a relevant way.
* Information resources are vast and can get out-of-date quickly. A proper online library should be create with mechanisms to rate relevancy.
