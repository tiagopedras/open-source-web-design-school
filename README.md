Open Source Web Design School
=============================
The education world is chancing. The web is part of that change. Still, there seems to be very few changes when it comes to teach the web.
This project (and this document alone) seeks to establish the foundations for a new movement that aims to teach the web in better, faster, more flexible way. One that adapts to industry, to the students needs and, most of all, to the natural evolution of the web itself.
This is a collaborative effort and your contribute as a teacher/mentor, designer/developer, student of industry leader is important to help raise education for web design and development to the next level.


##Objectives
1. To define the terms of a working and living institution/movement that is not only replicable but built by the industry and for the industry.
2. All of the programs, exercises, objectives, methodologies must be modular, dynamic and updatable, allowing any intervenient —wether a student, a teacher, a mentor or a company — to contribute to it's evolution and adaptation with up-to-date tech requirements and industry needs.
3. Students need to be autonomous and at the base of their initial teachings should be "how to solve problems" (even if their problem is "how to learn X") adopting a Design Thinking posture at pretty much all times.
4. A learn-by-doing methodology must be at the core of all. It is imperative that students learn in a collaborative environment and develop hard and soft skills alike.

##Caveats
* Different students will have different life objectives. Expectations management is crucial for the success of the school.
* Different students will also have different skill levels and special needs. It is important to create tools, methodologies and options so that everyone is able to build it's own curriculum with clear targets in sight.
* The industry and technology evolve at a far faster pace than traditional universities. Agility and modularity can help keep the pace so that every exercise, project and topic is kept in a relevant way.
* Information resources are vast and can get out-of-date quickly. A proper online library should be create with mechanisms to rate relevancy.
* Every designer should know how to code or what good code is like. Every programmer should know how to design or what good design is like.
